- CEO or appropriate individual designated by the hospital to determine if the hospital is in compliance with Federal laws related to patient health and safety. (For example, ask if the hospital was cited since its last survey for any violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 related to denying people with disabilities access to care. If so, verify that satisfactory corrections have been made to bring the hospital into compliance with that law.)

Document Review

General
- Prior to the survey, determine whether the hospital has a current license issued by the state or local authority in which it operates, or, if it is located within a State that does not license hospitals, verify that the responsible State agency has approved the hospital as meeting the State’s established standards for the licensing of hospitals.
- Verify the hospital has established and follows procedures for determining that personnel are properly licensed, certified, and/or permitted as required by the state.  
- Verify that the hospital has an established process which is followed to determine that staff and personnel meet all standards (such as continuing education, basic qualifications, hold permits) required by State and local laws or regulations. 

Personnel/Credential File 
- Review a sample of personnel files to verify that licensure and/or other required credentials information is up to date.
- Verify State licensure compliance of the direct care personnel as well as administrators and supervisory personnel.
- When telemedicine is used and the practitioner and patient are located in different states is the practitioner providing the patient care service licensed and/or meets the other applicable standards that are required by State or local laws in both the state where the practitioner is located and state where the patient is located.</ELE_TX>

Hospitals applying for initial Medicare certification as a hospital or hospitals currently participating in Medicare must, among other things, meet the statutory definition of a hospital under section 1861(e) of the Act. Section 1861(e)(7) of the Act further requires that a hospital located in a state which provides for the licensing of hospitals, the hospital must be licensed in accordance with state law or approved as meeting standards for licensing as established by the agency of the State or locality responsible for the licensing of hospitals.

While a facility may have a license from a state to operate as a hospital or may have been approved by a state as a hospital under state or local standards and authorities, that facility may still not meet the Medicare definition of a hospital as per the Act. The criteria used by a state to determine that a hospital meets the requirements for state licensure as a hospital is not the same criteria used to define a hospital for the purpose of participation in Medicare, and each state has its own criteria and standards for licensure.

The definition of a hospital and the issue of whether the facility is Primarily Engaged are issues not applicable to a Critical Access Hospital (CAH).</ELE_TX>

All staff that are required by the State to be licensed must possess a current license. The hospital must assure that these personnel are in compliance with the State’s licensure laws. The laws requiring licensure vary from state to state. Examples of healthcare professionals that a state may require to be licensed could include: nurses, MD/DOs, physician assistants, dieticians, x-ray technologists, dentists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, respiratory therapists and hospital administrators.

All staff must meet all applicable standards required by State or local law for hospital personnel. This would include at a minimum:

• Certification requirements;
• Minimum qualifications;
• Training/education requirements; and
• Permits (such as food handlers permits).

When telemedicine is used and the practitioner and patient are located in different states, the practitioner providing the patient care service must be licensed and/or meet the other applicable standards that are required by State or local laws in both the state where the practitioner is located and the state where the patient is located.</ELE_TX>

• Verify for those personnel required to be licensed, certified, and/or permitted by the State, that the hospital has established, and follows procedures for determining that personnel are properly licensed, certified, and/or permitted.

• Verify that staff and personnel are licensed, certified, and/or permitted in accordance with State and local requirements.

• Verify that staff and personnel meet all standards (such as continuing education, basic qualifications, etc.) required by State and local laws or regulations. Verify that the hospital has a mechanism established and enforced to ensure compliance.

• Review a sample of personnel files to verify that licensure and/or other required credentials information is up to date. Verify State licensure compliance of the direct care personnel as well as administrators and supervisory personnel.</ELE_TX>
