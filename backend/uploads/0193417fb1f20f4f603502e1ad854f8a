      <cop_tx>(iii) Unless it is a unit in a critical access hospital, the hospital of which an IRF is a unit must have at least 10 staffed and maintained hospital beds that are not excluded from the inpatient prospective payment system, or at least 1 staffed and maintained hospital bed for every 10 certified inpatient rehabilitation facility beds, whichever number is greater. Otherwise, the IRF will be classified as an IRF hospital, rather than an IRF unit. In the case of an inpatient psychiatric facility unit, the hospital must have enough beds that are not excluded from the inpatient prospective payment system to permit the provision of adequate cost information, as required by §413.24(c) of this chapter.</cop_tx>
